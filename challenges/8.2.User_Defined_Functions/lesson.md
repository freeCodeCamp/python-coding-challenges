## User Defined Functions

The keyword `def` introduces a function definition.  
It must be followed by the function name and a parenthesized list of formal parameters (if any).  
The statements that form the body of the function start at the next line, and must be indented.  
After a function has been defined, it can be called by typing the function name immediately followed by parentheses that contain the function's arguments (if any).

**_Instructions:_**  
**Define a function named say_hello() that has no parameters and prints the string "Hello World!" to the console.**  
**Your function should not contain a return statement, only a print statement.**  
**After you have defined the function, call it.**
